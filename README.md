# practicepython.org

Collection of exercises from http://www.practicepython.org which will be quite boring to most...  However, if you enjoy programming in Python and want some fun exercises (for beginners), do yourself a favor and visit Michele Pratusevich's site!

PS: This is also an excuse to experiment with github.  Wheeeeee!
